[10/13/24, 5:03 PM] Alex: Brooooo, guess what happened today?
[10/13/24, 5:03 PM] Jordan: What now? 😂 Spill it.
[10/13/24, 5:03 PM] Alex: I ran into Emily at the coffee shop, and we had the most awkward convo ever.
[10/13/24, 5:04 PM] Jordan: 😳 What happened? Did you trip or something?
[10/13/24, 5:04 PM] Alex: Nah, worse. I totally blanked out when she asked how my semester's going. Just stood there like a statue 😭
[10/13/24, 5:04 PM] Jordan: Dude. Classic Alex move. Did you at least recover?
[10/13/24, 5:05 PM] Alex: Kinda? I mumbled something about "studying hard" but sounded like I was dying inside 😬
[10/13/24, 5:05 PM] Jordan: LOL. You need to work on your social skills, man. Next time, just talk about your favorite subject… yourself 😂
[10/13/24, 5:06 PM] Alex: Haha, shut up 😒 Anyway, she was super nice about it. I might've saved it by mentioning the Halloween party next weekend.
[10/13/24, 5:06 PM] Jordan: Ohhhhh, smooth move. Did you invite her?
[10/13/24, 5:06 PM] Alex: Yup, and she said she’d “think about it.” Soooo, I’ll take that as a yes?
[10/13/24, 5:07 PM] Jordan: For sure, bro. Now you just gotta plan a killer costume. You going as anything?
[10/13/24, 5:07 PM] Alex: Thinking of doing something simple like a vampire. What about you?
[10/13/24, 5:07 PM] Jordan: I'm going all out—gonna be a pirate, but like, full Jack Sparrow vibes 🏴‍☠️
[10/13/24, 5:07 PM] Alex: Dude, that’s gonna be epic. Please tell me you have the hat and everything.
[10/13/24, 5:08 PM] Jordan: Of course. Got the hat, the boots, and even the eyeliner. Gotta commit, bro.
[10/13/24, 5:08 PM] Alex: 😂😂 You’re wild. This party better be worth it.
[10/13/24, 5:08 PM] Jordan: It will be. Trust. If Emily shows up, you owe me dinner.
[10/13/24, 5:08 PM] Alex: Deal. But if I embarrass myself again, you’re taking over all convos with her from now on.
[10/13/24, 5:09 PM] Jordan: Done. I’m a wingman for life. 🙌
