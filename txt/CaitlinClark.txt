[10/13/24, 8:30 PM] Caitlin: Yo, guess what just happened at practice today.
[10/13/24, 8:30 PM] Jess: Ooooh, something epic? Did you break another record? 😎
[10/13/24, 8:31 PM] Caitlin: Haha, nah, but close. I hit a half-court shot... twice... in a row. 
[10/13/24, 8:31 PM] Jess: 😲 What?! Twice in a row?! Okay, showoff!
[10/13/24, 8:32 PM] Caitlin: Right? Even coach was like, "Okay, save it for the game, Clark." 😂
[10/13/24, 8:32 PM] Jess: Haha, you’re ridiculous. Are you ever gonna miss a shot again?
[10/13/24, 8:32 PM] Caitlin: Let’s hope not. I’m on fire lately. 🔥 But seriously, I need to work on my defense more.
[10/13/24, 8:33 PM] Jess: Pshhh, defense is overrated. Just shoot from half-court every time. Problem solved. 😜
[10/13/24, 8:33 PM] Caitlin: LOL, if only it worked like that! What about you? How’s life off the court?
[10/13/24, 8:34 PM] Jess: Meh, nothing as exciting as your life. Just drowning in schoolwork and trying not to lose my mind.
[10/13/24, 8:34 PM] Caitlin: Ugh, I feel that. Balancing basketball and classes is a nightmare sometimes. Hang in there!
[10/13/24, 8:35 PM] Jess: Trying! Buuut I may need a night out soon to keep my sanity intact. You down?
[10/13/24, 8:35 PM] Caitlin: Oh, you KNOW I’m down. We deserve a break! Let’s hit up that new spot downtown this weekend.
[10/13/24, 8:36 PM] Jess: Yassss! I’m already picking out my outfit. Let’s gooooo! 💃
[10/13/24, 8:36 PM] Caitlin: Haha, same here! Gotta show up in style. Alright, let’s plan it. Catch you later!
[10/13/24, 8:37 PM] Jess: You bet! Peace out, superstar. 🏀
[10/13/24, 8:37 PM] Caitlin: Later, legend. 😎
