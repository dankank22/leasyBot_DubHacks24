[10/13/24, 9:00 PM] Rome: Dude, you will NOT believe what just happened at the gym.
[10/13/24, 9:00 PM] Max: Oh boy, what now? Did you finally lift more than 10 pounds? 😂
[10/13/24, 9:01 PM] Rome: Haha, very funny. No, I was on the treadmill, minding my own business, when the guy next to me fell off... and kept sliding! 
[10/13/24, 9:01 PM] Max: NOOO, bro, please tell me you didn’t laugh out loud.
[10/13/24, 9:02 PM] Rome: I tried so hard not to, but man, it was like something out of a cartoon. He just kept going.
[10/13/24, 9:02 PM] Max: 😂😂 I’m crying just picturing it. Did anyone help him up?
[10/13/24, 9:03 PM] Rome: Yeah, the staff came over, but he got up like nothing happened. Full-on played it off.
[10/13/24, 9:03 PM] Max: Respect. I would’ve crawled out of the gym in shame. 
[10/13/24, 9:04 PM] Rome: Right? I almost tripped just from laughing too hard. My workout was basically done after that.
[10/13/24, 9:04 PM] Max: So... you went to the gym just to laugh? Productive day. 😜
[10/13/24, 9:05 PM] Rome: Hey, laughing burns calories too! I'm counting it.
[10/13/24, 9:05 PM] Max: Haha, alright, I'll let it slide. So what’s up for the weekend? You free?
[10/13/24, 9:06 PM] Rome: Yeah, totally. Thinking of hitting that new burger spot. You down?
[10/13/24, 9:06 PM] Max: Say no more. I’m ALWAYS down for burgers. 🍔
[10/13/24, 9:07 PM] Rome: I knew you would be. Let’s meet at 6?
[10/13/24, 9:07 PM] Max: Deal. Just don’t spill anything this time. 😉
[10/13/24, 9:08 PM] Rome: NO promises. 😂 See you then!
[10/13/24, 9:08 PM] Max: Later, bro.
