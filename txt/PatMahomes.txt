[10/13/24, 10:00 PM] Pat: Bro, you won't believe what happened in practice today.
[10/13/24, 10:00 PM] Ty: Oh man, did you throw another no-look pass? 😂
[10/13/24, 10:01 PM] Pat: Nah, but close! I threw a 60-yard pass... from my knees. 
[10/13/24, 10:01 PM] Ty: Wait, from your knees?! What are you, a superhero? 😳
[10/13/24, 10:02 PM] Pat: Haha, I’m not saying I am, but I’m also not saying I’m not. 😎
[10/13/24, 10:02 PM] Ty: Man, you're unreal. Did Coach freak out or what?
[10/13/24, 10:03 PM] Pat: Nah, he just shook his head like, “Here we go again.” 😂
[10/13/24, 10:03 PM] Ty: Dude, you’re out here doing Madden stuff in real life. I need that energy on my fantasy team, like, NOW.
[10/13/24, 10:04 PM] Pat: Haha, just wait till Sunday. I’ll make sure to get you those points.
[10/13/24, 10:04 PM] Ty: You better, bro. My whole lineup depends on you. No pressure or anything. 😜
[10/13/24, 10:05 PM] Pat: None at all, right? 😂
[10/13/24, 10:05 PM] Ty: But for real, how’s the season shaping up for you? You feeling good?
[10/13/24, 10:06 PM] Pat: Yeah, man, feeling great. The team’s looking solid, and I’m in the zone. Can’t wait to see how it all plays out.
[10/13/24, 10:06 PM] Ty: Let’s goooooo! You’re about to have an MVP season again, I can feel it.
[10/13/24, 10:07 PM] Pat: Appreciate that, bro. Just gotta keep grinding.
[10/13/24, 10:07 PM] Ty: Always. Alright, man, I’ll let you get back to it. See you on game day!
[10/13/24, 10:08 PM] Pat: You know it. Catch you later!
