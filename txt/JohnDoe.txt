[10/13/24, 7:20 PM] John: Hey man, you won't believe what just happened to me today.
[10/13/24, 7:20 PM] Chris: Oh boy, here we go. Let me guess, another awkward elevator moment? 😂
[10/13/24, 7:21 PM] John: Worse. I spilled coffee all over my boss’s desk… right before our meeting. 🙃
[10/13/24, 7:21 PM] Chris: NO WAY. Dude, how are you still employed?!
[10/13/24, 7:21 PM] John: Honestly, I have no idea. I tried to play it cool like, “Oh, who needs coffee, right?” But the look on her face… priceless.
[10/13/24, 7:22 PM] Chris: Bro. You have a gift for chaos. Did she at least laugh?
[10/13/24, 7:22 PM] John: Not even a smile. Just a cold, hard stare. I think my career flashed before my eyes.
[10/13/24, 7:23 PM] Chris: RIP John Doe. It was a good run. 😂
[10/13/24, 7:23 PM] John: Right? If you don't hear from me in the next few days, just know I'm job hunting.
[10/13/24, 7:23 PM] Chris: Haha, nah, you’ll be fine. Just lay low for a while. Maybe avoid spilling liquids for the next decade. 
[10/13/24, 7:24 PM] John: Solid advice. I’ll stick to water bottles with lids from now on.
[10/13/24, 7:24 PM] Chris: 😂 That's the spirit! But hey, real talk—how’s the new project going?
[10/13/24, 7:25 PM] John: It's alright. Deadlines are tight, though. Feels like I’m running a marathon at sprint speed.
[10/13/24, 7:25 PM] Chris: Oh man, that sounds brutal. You pulling all-nighters again?
[10/13/24, 7:26 PM] John: You know it. I’m practically living off energy drinks and bad decisions.
[10/13/24, 7:26 PM] Chris: Classic John. Well, if you need a distraction, I’m always down for a game night.
[10/13/24, 7:27 PM] John: Don’t tempt me. I might just bail on work and show up at your place with a pizza.
[10/13/24, 7:27 PM] Chris: Haha, you know you’re always welcome. Just leave the coffee at home. 😉
[10/13/24, 7:27 PM] John: Deal. See you soon, bro.
[10/13/24, 7:28 PM] Chris: Later, man. Don’t get fired before then. 😂
