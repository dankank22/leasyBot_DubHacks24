[5/7/23, 4:01:32 PM] RP: ANSWER::

(a)

For Verbal Reasoning section we have N(151, 7).

For Quantitative Reasoning section we have N(153, 7.67).

(b)

The z-score for verbal Reasoning section is

X-
160 – 151
= 1.29
7

The z-score for Quantitative Reasoning section is

X-
157 – 153
7,67
= 0.52

(c)

These are standarized normal score that shows the position of scores on standard normal curve.

(d)

Since z-score for verbal Reasoning section is higher so Sophia did better in verbal reasoning section.

(e)

The percentile rank on verbal reasoning score is

P(z<1.29) = 0.9015

So requried percentile is 90.15.

The percentile rank on Quantitative reasoning score is

P(z<0.52) = 0.6985

So requried percentile is 69.85.

(f)

For verbal reasoning section:

The required percentage is

P(z > 1.29) = 1-0.9015 = 0.0985 = 9.85%

For quantitaive reasoning section:

The required percentage is

P(z > 0.52) = 1-0.6985 = 0.3015 = 30.15%

[5/21/23, 5:53:29 PM] RP: We can interpret the confidence interval as follows: With 95% confidence, we estimate that the proportion of 25-year-olds who are married falls between 20.50% and 27.44%. This means that based on our sample, the true proportion of 25-year-olds who are married is likely to be within this range. Additionally, since the confidence interval does not include the previously suggested 25% proportion, it provides evidence against that claim.
Explanation:
in the above step we have calculated part 2

[1/23/24, 2:38:15 PM] Ashwin: The two hashCode() implementations provided have different characteristics in terms of how they distribute hash values for strings, which affects the number of collisions you might expect in a hash table.

Option 1:
This implementation simply adds up the hash codes of the individual characters in the string (which are the ASCII values of the characters). This means that any two strings with the same characters, regardless of their order, will have the same hash code. For example, "abc" and "cba" will have the same hash code. This can result in a high number of collisions because it doesn't account for character position within the string.

Option 2:
This uses Java's actual String hashCode implementation, which considers both the character value and its position in the string. The use of 31 (a prime number) as a multiplier helps in distributing the hash values more uniformly for different strings, even if they contain the same characters. Therefore, strings with the same characters but in different orders will generally have different hash codes, leading to fewer collisions.

In general, Option 2 will result in a greater number of unique hash code values and thus fewer collisions because it incorporates both the character values and their positions in the string. Option 1 is likely to result in a greater number of collisions because it generates the same hash code for strings that are anagrams of each other.

[1/31/24, 4:57:24 PM] RP: tcreate me a simple set of pros and cons for each data structure when trying to implement a solution such as an artist's songs along with ratings. compare Hashtables, BST, AVL, ArrayLists and LinkedLists and list their pros and cons in general and in respect to my solution request. Make sure to list the best and worst case runtime examples to help me understand how taxing each solution is. 
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's analyze the pros and cons of each data structure in the context of implementing a solution for managing an artist's songs along with ratings.

Hashtable:
Pros:

Fast Retrieval: O(1) average case time complexity for lookups, making it efficient for accessing data.
Dynamic Size: Can dynamically resize to accommodate the growing number of songs.
Simple Implementation: Easy to implement and use.
Cons:

No Order: Items are not stored in a specific order, which may not be suitable for scenarios where order matters.
Hash Collisions: May experience collisions, leading to degraded performance.
Best Case: O(1) (when there are no collisions)
Worst Case: O(n) (if many collisions occur and all items end up in the same bucket)

Binary Search Tree (BST):
Pros:

Ordered Storage: Maintains a sorted order, which could be useful for applications that require sorted data.
Efficient Search: O(log n) average case time complexity for lookups.
Cons:

Imbalanced Tree: Without balancing, the tree can become skewed, leading to worst-case scenarios of O(n) for search operations.
Complex Implementation: Implementing a balanced BST (e.g., AVL tree) adds complexity.
Best Case: O(log n) (balanced tree)
Worst Case: O(n) (unbalanced tree)

AVL Tree:
Pros:

Balanced: Guarantees a balanced tree, ensuring O(log n) time complexity for search operations.
Ordered Storage: Maintains a sorted order.
Cons:

Complexity: More complex to implement than a basic BST.
Overhead: Requires additional bookkeeping to maintain balance.
Best Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)

ArrayList:
Pros:

Fast Access: O(1) time complexity for direct access using indices.
Dynamic Sizing: Can dynamically resize to accommodate the growing number of songs.
Cons:

Insertion/Deletion Overhead: O(n) time complexity for inserting or deleting elements in the middle, as it may require shifting elements.
Best Case: O(1) (for direct access)
Worst Case: O(n) (for insertion or deletion in the middle)

LinkedList:
Pros:

Efficient Insertion/Deletion: O(1) time complexity for inserting or deleting elements, assuming you have a reference to the node.
Dynamic Sizing: Can dynamically resize.
Cons:

Sequential Access: O(n) time complexity for random access, as you may need to traverse the list.
Best Case: O(1) (for insertion/deletion with a reference)
Worst Case: O(n) (for random access)

Summary:
If you need fast and direct access to songs with ratings, and order doesn't matter, a Hashtable might be a good choice.
If maintaining a sorted order is important, and you can handle potential imbalances, a BST could be suitable.
If balance is crucial and you want guaranteed O(log n) search time, consider an AVL Tree.
If you need fast direct access and don't perform frequent insertions or deletions in the middle, an ArrayList is efficient.
If you frequently insert or delete elements, a LinkedList could be beneficial.
Choose the data structure based on the specific requirements and operations in your use case.

[2/1/24, 4:50:03 PM] Ashwin: Ima. Fucking genius
[2/1/24, 4:56:45 PM] Ashwin: was your load factor less than 0.8
[2/1/24, 4:57:04 PM] Ashwin: i think we are failing a time test case
[2/1/24, 5:10:09 PM] RP: 0.75

[2/1/24, 6:31:03 PM] Ashwin: on the time of execution
[2/1/24, 6:31:18 PM] Ashwin: we kept as 0.8 and failed a test case that was 1.5 marks
[2/1/24, 6:31:25 PM] Ashwin: changed to 0.6 works now

[2/6/24, 11:01:23 PM] RP: one sec
[2/6/24, 11:05:37 PM] RP: In a trie we insert each pattern that is given. The worst-case run time is O(n*h) where n is the number of patterns and the h is the height of the longest branch. This is because the trie will iterate through each of the branches checking for an ambiguous case and the worst case possible time is O(n*h).

[3/10/24, 12:41:30 PM] RP: Apply Dijkstra's algorithm with Mr. Meow Meow as the starting point to determine the shortest paths to all other vertices in the graph, representing the minimum time needed to inform each student. If a student is unreachable from Mr. Meow Meow, the algorithm will assign infinity to that student. In such cases, output -1 to indicate that it is not feasible for all students to be informed. Otherwise, examine the list of path lengths to each student and return the maximum shortest path length, signifying the earliest time for everyone to be informed.
[3/10/24, 12:41:35 PM] RP: aakash's friend answer
[3/10/24, 12:41:37 PM] RP: ofc change it a bit

[3/10/24, 12:55:09 PM] RP: can you send 1.1 too
[3/10/24, 12:55:24 PM] RP: or ill ask u at 3
[3/10/24, 12:55:26 PM] RP: chill for now
‎[3/10/24, 12:55:55 PM] Ashwin: ‎image omitted
[3/10/24, 4:23:56 PM] RP: for this scenario, we need to use Djikstra's algorithm with Mr.Meow Meow as the starting node. We will then find the shortest path that connect all vertices in the graph which will represent the minimum time that is required to reach every student. If any student is unreachable in our shortest path finder, we will assign that path as imppssible and the algorithm will return -1 signifiying that all students were not reached. Otherwise, the alogrithm will analyse path lengths of each of the students and return the shortest path to each student and return the sum of that path.
[3/10/24, 4:32:45 PM] RP: I will iterate through the problemAssignments array and check for questions that have null values, this will create O(n) runtime. The heap (TA's names) will be made based on the priority of the number of questions a TA has been assigned (higher priority to TA's assigned lesser questions). The runtime of doing this will be O(klogn). Every time I hit a null value in the array, I will call removeMin from my heap and I will insert the TA's name that is outputted. The priority of that TA is now adjusted based on the additional question they have been assigned. They are added back into the heap with this new priority.  I will update the hashtable of TA's names to problems assigned with the newest problem that they have been assigned. The heap then finds the next removeMin TA who is assigned for the next null problem in the given array. The result of this creates an O(n +klogn) runtime.
