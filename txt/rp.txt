[10/13/24, 6:10 PM] Sam: Yo! You won't believe what just happened.
[10/13/24, 6:10 PM] Jamie: What now? You finally learned how to cook without burning the kitchen? 🤣
[10/13/24, 6:11 PM] Sam: 😑 Very funny. No, I saw a raccoon casually walking into Starbucks. Just strolling in like it owned the place.
[10/13/24, 6:11 PM] Jamie: LOL wait, did anyone do anything? Did the raccoon get its latte? 😂
[10/13/24, 6:12 PM] Sam: Bro, the staff were like, "Excuse me, sir, you can't be here." And it just stood there like, "I'm waiting for my caramel macchiato." 😂
[10/13/24, 6:12 PM] Jamie: That’s gold. Did anyone freak out though?
[10/13/24, 6:13 PM] Sam: Some lady screamed, and another dude just took a selfie with it like it was a celebrity. The raccoon was clearly unbothered. Chillest guy in the room.
[10/13/24, 6:14 PM] Jamie: Bruh, I feel that raccoon’s vibe. That’s how I’m walking into work tomorrow. 😎
[10/13/24, 6:14 PM] Sam: Haha, same! Gonna stroll in like, "Yeah, I’m late, but I look good doing it."
[10/13/24, 6:15 PM] Jamie: 😂 Honestly, we all need that raccoon energy in life.
[10/13/24, 6:15 PM] Sam: Facts. Also, speaking of work, how’s that project going? You surviving or nah?
[10/13/24, 6:16 PM] Jamie: Surviving? Barely. My brain is running on two brain cells and a lot of coffee.
[10/13/24, 6:16 PM] Sam: Yikes. Sounds like you need a vacation. Or maybe just a nap.
[10/13/24, 6:16 PM] Jamie: Nap first, vacation later. My soul is tired, man. 😴
[10/13/24, 6:17 PM] Sam: I feel you. Let’s just run away, join the raccoon gang, and live life carefree in Starbucks.
[10/13/24, 6:17 PM] Jamie: I’m down. We’ll make raccoon hoodies a thing. #SquadGoals 🦝
[10/13/24, 6:18 PM] Sam: Haha, alright, it’s a plan. Now, seriously, go rest before you pass out mid-sentence.
[10/13/24, 6:18 PM] Jamie: Yeah, you’re right. I’ll catch you later. Peace out, future raccoon king. ✌️
[10/13/24, 6:19 PM] Sam: Peace out, minion. 😂
